# sae401_402_back

This repository contains a part of a project we worked on during the second year of our BUT MMI program.
Our task was to completely overhaul the IUTâ€™s communication (logo, visual identity, website, etc.).

Regarding the website, the workload was split between two of us. My responsibility was to develop the back-end of the website,
which needed to allow administrators to easily create new pages, publish news, highlight projects, and more.

This project is based on TinyMCE, a JavaScript tool that allows users to input text directly through a website.
The back-end was implemented using PHP, SQL, and JavaScript.
